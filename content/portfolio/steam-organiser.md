I developed the Steam Organiser *(great name, I know)* to help manage my ever growing mountain of Steam games. With it, 
you can add any game from the steam catalog to your backlog, and mark them as completed whenever you're finished with 
them. The Steam Organiser also has a library page, where you can sort and filter every game in your library, making it 
even easier to manage your games. To use it, all you need to do is to log in with your [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) 
credentials, and you can immediately start managing your backlog!
