Pokédot is a Pokémon database that uses the [Veekun](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) Pokémon database. It contains
detailed information about every Pokémon, which includes: forms, types, base stats, evolutions, moves, and much more. 
In the future, it will include a team builder allowing for easy composition of effective Pokémon teams.
